# chesscv-2021

Android app that let's you take an upside-down photo of a chess table and returns you the digital "equivalent" so that you may continue playing on your phone :)

Idea inspired by this [blog](https://tech.bakkenbaeck.com/post/chessvision).

We also used the same [dataset](https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/chessvision?fbclid=IwAR2y2l8PFnA22xlHoGvxKIn6VuWxv1DClmfUHv1VNYvZnlQriYqVB-w2cs0) as them to train our model.

For chessboard detection we used the solution from this [github repo](https://github.com/maciejczyzewski/neural-chessboard). Related paper: [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03898.pdf).
